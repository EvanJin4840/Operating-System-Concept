1. Memory Hierarchy & Locality
Concept: Organizes storage from fast/expensive (Cache) to slow/cheap (Disk).

Principle of Locality: Programs tend to reuse data (Temporal) or nearby data (Spatial), making caches highly effective.

2. Virtual Memory
Concept: An abstraction that provides each process with a large, contiguous memory space, even if the physical RAM is smaller and fragmented.

Key Benefit: Enables multitasking and running large applications with limited RAM.

3. Paging
Concept: A memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory.

Mechanism: It divides logical memory into Pages and physical memory into Frames. A Page Table maps these two, allowing flexible and efficient memory usage.
