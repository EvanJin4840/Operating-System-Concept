* Process vs. Thread: A process is a program in execution with its own address space. A thread is a unit of execution within a process that shares the process's resources.

* Context Switching: The process of saving the state of a CPU (in the PCB - Process Control Block) so it can be restored and resume execution later.

* IPC (Inter-Process Communication): Mechanisms like Shared Memory or Message Passing that allow processes to communicate.
